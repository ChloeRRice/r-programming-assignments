The generated boxplots show much less variance in Low blood pressures between the initial assessments and the second and final decisions. Low and High blood pressures tend to have a difference in variance as well, with Low being more consistent. The histogram reveals that Most Visit Frequencies tended to be between 0.1 and 0.4. There were no notable outliers in the visit frequency. The histogram of Blood Pressure shows a wide variety of blood pressures, with a notable outlier at over 200. The results of this histogram's visualization could be modified by using different bins for the data. The data is made-up, meaning it would not have any real world implications. However, if it were real the sample size would be a notable limitation for it's analysis, as the sample size is far to small to rule out random chance in any of the results. 

The na.omit function completely removes row that contain an NA value, which may be useful in some scenarios but it's use may significantly reduce or skew the amount of remaining data. In this situation it removed only one row,  however considering the data contained 10 rows that was a tenth of the data, significantly affecting the results.
